## ℹ About
Depevolep using [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io) to improve my front-end skills, my challenge is to build out this introductory component and get it looking as close to the design as possible..

You can find this challenge on their website, where you can see the `style-guide.md` and images to help you.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*
